# Decathlon Calculation

Just a code training nothing more nothing less

## About project

-You may need to add lombok plugin if your ide gives error or you can generate jar direclty with maven without any setup. https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij


## Assumptions I have made

-For measure I have accepted metres and seconds as standarts.

-For Long Jump , High Jump and Pole Vault point calculations. Given values for 1000 pts not matches with formula , 
however I have seen same results on internet so I accepted them as correct values.
